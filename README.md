# ESP8266-LED-Websockets
My code for creating a wooden block LED light with RGB + white WS2812 led strips.
This code makes it controllable from any webbrowser, with the files hosted on the ESP8266.
So no external server needed.

This is still a WIP. The upload via Arduino IDE is broken... As is the mdns server....
